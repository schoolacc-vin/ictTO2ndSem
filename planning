## When a customer arrives at the ENTRANCE, the USER will check car sticker and record data
I suppose that combobox would work here because the user (specifically staff) fill in the driver's information for giving the ticket to the customer.

## Display Amount Price to pay (see computation)
This part might be challenging because it involves mathematical computation. I think radiobutton should work for this case.
